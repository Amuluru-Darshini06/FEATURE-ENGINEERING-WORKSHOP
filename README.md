# FEATURE-ENGINEERING-WORKSHOP

🧠 Feature Engineering Workshop — Transforming Data Into Intelligence 🚀
Welcome to the official codebase for the Feature Engineering Workshop, a deep-dive into turning raw data into high-impact features that significantly improve machine learning model performance.

This repository contains all the code examples, exercises, and datasets used in the hands-on workshop designed to teach practical and powerful techniques for preparing your data like a pro.

📁 What’s Inside This Repository:
notebooks/ — Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating step-by-step transformations

datasets/ — Sample datasets used throughout the workshop

utils/ — Custom helper functions for common preprocessing tasks

feature_pipeline.py — Modular pipeline for automated feature engineering

requirements.txt — Dependencies for a seamless setup

🔍 Topics Covered:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

📊 Handling Missing Values & Outliers

🧬 Encoding Categorical Features (Label, One-Hot, Target)

📐 Feature Scaling (Standardization, Normalization, Log Transformation)

🔎 Feature Selection (Variance Threshold, Correlation Filtering, Recursive Feature Elimination)

🧩 Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE intro)

🔁 Automated Feature Engineering Pipelines

💡 Why Feature Engineering?
Models are only as good as the data they learn from. Feature engineering enables:

Higher model accuracy

Better generalization

Improved interpretability

Faster convergence and reduced training time

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook
